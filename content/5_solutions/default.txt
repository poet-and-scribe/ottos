## ottosCares
GPs in Europe are facing a global crisis.

ottosSTUDIO
For our lighthouse client, ottosSTUDIO was designed to enable the Studio founder to invest more time building a community and creating well being!

​

For our dear friend Crystal, creating a community and building a wellbeing practice was far more important than scheduling and payment processing.

​

Maintaining her unique tone of voice and engaging customers in the right way were paramount in our first live product.



Now, ottosSTUDIO engages with her community, offers her products and services to the world, schedules people into her classes and takes payments - all with minimal human touch.
