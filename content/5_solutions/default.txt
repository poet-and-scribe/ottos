## ottosRX (need something more clear that this is about clinical trials)
Where it all began! ottosAI was conceived with Pharmaceutical trial recruitment, retention and regimen adherence in mind.

By learning all there is to know about the patient, available trials, the care regime and the drug itself, ottosRX optimizes trial selection and orchestrates compliant engagement every time.

Through the collation of data at every stage, patient, trial and drug 'fingerprints' enable forensic appraisal of trial outcomes and drive continuous learning.

## ottosCares
GPs in Europe are facing a global crisis.

​

Our contacts in the National Health industry spoke to us about the increasing pressure their GP surgeries and Hospitals are facing.

​

An aging population paired with a decreasing health care professional population is driving burned out carers and dissatisfied patients.

​

Our analysis shows that nearly half of the inbound traffic into GPs and Hospitals could be fully automated using ottosCARE, allowing doctors and nurses to focus on what's important.

## ottosStudio
ottosSTUDIO
For our lighthouse client, ottosSTUDIO was designed to enable the Studio founder to invest more time building a community and creating well being!

​

For our dear friend Crystal, creating a community and building a wellbeing practice was far more important than scheduling and payment processing.

​

Maintaining her unique tone of voice and engaging customers in the right way were paramount in our first live product.

 

Now, ottosSTUDIO engages with her community, offers her products and services to the world, schedules people into her classes and takes payments - all with minimal human touch.

## ottosEvent
Italy's premier event management company needed to release their incredible event team to focus on supporting their attendees.

​

ottosAI experienced first hand the trials and tribulations of managing large scale, complex events in Italy.

​

What they saw were brilliant people spending hours on basic information sharing and scheduling so working with prestigious Italian partners, ottosEVENT was born!

 

Now the basic, repetitive tasks can be automated through ottosAI leaving their super heroes to attend to their beloved attendees.

 

ottosEVENT - helps people manage events, not events manage people...
